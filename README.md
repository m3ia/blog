# GWOAT: Greatest Women Of All Time
## What it is: 
Building a blog site was one of my weekly projects at [Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/). I really enjoyed building a full-stack web application where users can add posts, styled with HTML, to depict their favorite woman artist. 

## Design
The design is reminiscent of customized Xanga or Tumblr pages from the 2000-2010's. 

## Shoutouts: 
Techtonica, as well as my cohort mates from the H2 2022 cohort who contributed their favorite GWOATs as content.
